# ABSTRACT: WomeninBotany is a Web Application of a bibliographic database

# Set flags and add plugins for the application.
#
# Note that ORDERING IS IMPORTANT here as plugins are initialized in order,
# therefore you almost certainly want to keep ConfigLoader at the head of the
# list if you're using it.
#
#         -Debug: activates the debug mode for very useful log messages
#   ConfigLoader: will load the configuration from a Config::General file in the
#                 application's home directory
# Static::Simple: will serve static files from the application's root
#                 directory
